##DevOps playbook for evidation project: test.

The intention of the project is to **set up a simple
[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) app, which has a couple of  
basic CRUD routes and a [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
database backend.** As long as the app has at least  
one action that writes to the database, you don't need to implement the full set of  
CRUD actions.
​
​
## The Runbook
​
#### Overview
The purpose of this runbook is to walk you through building a Sinatra app with postgres  
backend. This is a common pattern that we totally use on a regular basis within TNEDO, Inc...
​
#### The steps
1. Install prerequisites
    * Homebrew
    * Ruby
    * Sinatra

2. Configure a simple Sinatra app (e.g. `hello world`)
    * Creating an Index View in Sinatra (optional)
    * Configure the app to connect to the/a database using active_support
    * Adding Postgres to Sinatra
    ** create a config/directory in the root of your application and add a database.yml file to it.
    *execute bundle install 
    * Install Rakefile
```
require 'sinatra/activerecord'
require 'sinatra/activerecord/rake'
require './app'

3. Add a Model (e.g. ["User"](https://github.com/sinatra-activerecord/sinatra-activerecord) or "Item") which will be stored/managed in the database.
